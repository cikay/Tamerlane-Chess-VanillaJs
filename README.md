# Tamerlane Chess
Tamerlane chess consists of 10 * 11 dimensions and different chess pieces. Each player has 28 pieces at the start of the game. Detailed rules of the game can be found at the link below. Program The rules of the game are fully coded so that 2 players can play against each other. However, the paintings representing the peieces were prepared amateurly, so I need professional ones.
